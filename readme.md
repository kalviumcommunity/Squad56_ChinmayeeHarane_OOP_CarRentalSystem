# 🚗 Car Rental System

The **Car Rental System** is a streamlined solution to automate the car rental process. It offers an intuitive and efficient platform for customers to browse available vehicles, make reservations, and manage their bookings. For administrators, it provides a robust management system to oversee the car fleet, customer records, and rental transactions.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🔍 Model Information
- Customers can easily view all relevant details of the car they intend to rent, including the model, brand, and pricing.

### 🕒 Rent Duration Selection
- Customers can specify the number of days they wish to rent the car, ensuring the service meets their exact needs.

### 🚘 Car Selection
- Users can choose from a variety of available cars, each with its own unique features and pricing.

### 📄 Invoice Generation
- A complete invoice is generated for every rental, outlining the car details, rental duration, and total cost, ensuring transparency in every transaction.

## 🛠️ Core Concepts

### 🧱 Classes and Objects
- The system is built using well-defined classes representing different entities like `Car` and `Customer`.

### ➰ Pointers
- Pointers are utilized for dynamic memory management and efficient data handling.

### 📦 Array of Objects
- Arrays are used to manage multiple `Car` objects, making it easy to store and access car details.

### 🆕 New and Delete
- Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation are managed using `new` and `delete`, ensuring optimal resource utilization.

### ⚙️ Static Variables and Member Functions
- Static variables and functions are used to manage data and functionality shared across all instances of a class.

### 🚀 Constructors and Destructors
- Constructors initialize objects with default or specific values, while destructors handle any necessary cleanup.

### 👩‍💻 Abstract Class and Virtual Function
- Abstract classes and virtual functions enable the system to handle different car types through a uniform interface, promoting flexibility and scalability.

### 🧬 Inheritance
- Inheritance allows the creation of specialized classes from existing ones, reducing code redundancy.

### 🛡️ Encapsulation and Abstraction
- Encapsulation ensures that sensitive data is hidden from external interference, while abstraction simplifies the interaction with complex systems.

### 🎨 Polymorphism
- Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, enabling dynamic behavior and extensibility.
